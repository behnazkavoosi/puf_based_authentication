# A Distributed PUF-Based Mutual Authentication System with Self-Correction

This repository contains the code for building a distributed PUF-Based mutual authentication system on the Ethereum blockchain. The implementation leverages the power of [Truffle suite](https://trufflesuite.com/) as the development environment and utilizes [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/) for interaction with simulated nodes.

The code has been successfully compiled and tested under Ubuntu 18.04.
