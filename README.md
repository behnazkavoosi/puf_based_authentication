If you use this code, we kindly request that you cite the following paper:

B. K. Ghafi and B. M. -N. Maybodi, "A Distributed PUF-Based Mutual Authentication System with Self-Correction," 2020 28th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE), Tabriz, Iran, 2020, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/ICEE50131.2020.9260862.

This repository contains the code for building a distributed PUF-Based mutual authentication system on the Ethereum blockchain. The implementation leverages the power of [Truffle suite](https://trufflesuite.com/) as the development environment and utilizes [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/) for interaction with simulated nodes.

The code has been successfully compiled and tested under Ubuntu 18.04.
