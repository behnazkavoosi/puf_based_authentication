If you use this code, we kindly request that you cite the following paper:

B. K. Ghafi and B. M. -N. Maybodi, "A Distributed PUF-Based Mutual Authentication System with Self-Correction," 2020 28th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE), Tabriz, Iran, 2020, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/ICEE50131.2020.9260862.

This repository contains the code for building a distributed PUF-Based mutual authentication system on the Ethereum blockchain. The implementation leverages the power of Truffle as the development environment and utilizes web3js for interaction with simulated nodes.

The code has been successfully compiled and tested under Ubuntu 18.04.
